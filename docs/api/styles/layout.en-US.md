# Layout

In terms of layout, Kraken currently supports W3C standard [Flow Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout) and [Flexible Box Layout](https://developer .mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox).

## Layout

The display attribute defines the display type of the element, and controls the layout by specifying different values.

### Attributes

#### display

- Definition: Set the display type of the element.
- Property value: [block | inline-block | inline | flex | inline-flex | none]
- Reference: [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/CSS/display).
- Note: Kraken currently only supports block | inline-block | inline | flex | inline-flex | none.

## Flow Layout

Kraken supports CSS flow layout, that is, arranging elements in the document flow through inline and block, and at the same time through [display property](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/CSS /display) Change the default arrangement of elements.

### Inline elements

In the document flow, inline elements are displayed in the inline direction, that is, the direction in which the words are expressed in the sentence according to the document writing mode, starting from the left and displayed one by one.
The common tags displayed inline by default in Kraken are `<span>` `<img>` `<input>` `<a>`.

### Block element

In the document flow, block elements are displayed one after another, just like paragraphs in the writing mode of the document, starting from the top and moving down the page.
The common tags displayed at the block level by default in Kraken are `<div>` `<p>`.

## Flexbox layout
