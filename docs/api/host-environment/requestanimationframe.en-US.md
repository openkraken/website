# requestAnimationFrame

Kraken supports W3C [requestAnimationFrame API](https://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/#dom-windowanimationtiming-requestanimationframe), which is used to call the specified callback function before the next frame is drawn by the rendering engine. For how to use it, please refer to [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame).
